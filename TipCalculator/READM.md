Create a project called TipCalculator.


The main activity layout should contain one EditText, three buttons, and one TextView.


The first button should be labeled 15% and should take the amount entered in the EditText and calculate 15% of that value.
The second button should be labeled 18% and should take the amount entered in the EditText and calculate 18% of that value.
The third button should be labeled 20% and should take the amount entered in the EditText and calculate 20% of that value.

All the buttons should display the tip and total bill in the TextView with this format: Tip: $99.99, Total Bill: $99.99.
The widgets should be centered horizontally on the screen with the EditText on top, the button below it in a single row, and the TextView below the button.
